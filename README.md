## Inspiration
There are many social media platforms for every human concern. For example, there is Instagram for social life and LinkedIn for your professional career. However, the web still lacks a place for people/organisations to share ideas and promote action for our planet, Earth.

**WeChange**  is a web application that promotes action against issues like climate change and global warming by creating a space where users can interact and share ideas and host events concerning mother nature. 

## How we built it
We came up with the idea of making **WeChange** after a lot of brainstorming ideas to create a social impact around the theme **Environment**.
We started by penning every idea that each of the team members had during the brainstorming phase, we metamorphosed the idea into a rough web application design,
decided on our tech stack according to the requirement of the project and divided the workload into the split of two-member each. (BackEnd & FrontEnd)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made this project in 2 days and won Simplihacks 2.0ðŸ¥‡

## What's next for WeChange

**Possible Future Ideas to be implemented**
<li>Supplies required for the event can be ordered on the WeChange (eg. saplings required for tree plantation drives, etc.) </li>
<li> Forum for discussion on topics concerning climate change</li>
