## Inspiration
There are many social media platforms for every human concern. For example, there is Instagram for social life and LinkedIn for your professional career. However, the web still lacks a place for people/organisations to share ideas and promote action for our planet, Earth.

**WeChange**  is a web application that promotes action against issues like climate change and global warming by creating a space where users can interact and share ideas and host events concerning mother nature. 

## How we built it
We came up with the idea of making **WeChange** after a lot of brainstorming ideas to create a social impact around the theme **Environment**.
We started by penning every idea that each of the team members had during the brainstorming phase, we metamorphosed the idea into a rough web application design,
decided on our tech stack according to the requirement of the project and divided the workload into the split of two-member each. (BackEnd & FrontEnd)

## Challenges we ran into
There were two major challenges faced during the hacking phase by our team.
<dl>
<dt>Time Management</dt>
<dd> Since the project had to be completed within the deadline of 48 hours, so implementing the numerous ideas in a restricted period of time was a herculean task. We tried our best to make efficient use of the time we had by working in shifts so that our project progressed continuously. Some ideas like a forum were not implemented due to time constraints. </dd>

<dt>Working with SQL Schemas</dt>
<dd> Since the project had various entities like Users, Posts, Events, Comments mapping relations between them and creating API's for the database was made easy by the use of Prisma ORM </dd>
</dl>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to implement more than we thought we would be able to implement during the start of the hackathon. 
<b>The following objectives were achieved & implemented</b>
<li>An elegant UI which provides smooth user experience</li>
<li>Consistent API's for optimized performance to interact with database</li>
<li>Token authentication using JWT </li>
<li>Clean Code & good coding practices were followed</li>

## What we learned
We stumbled upon many challenges as mentioned above through these challenges we were successful in equipping ourselves with new skills like implementing and using Web APIs, learning and implementing new concepts and technologies, and also strengthened
our existing skills like teamwork, UI/UX development, and pair programming.

## What's next for WeChange

**Possible Future Ideas to be implemented**
<li>Supplies required for the event can be ordered on the WeChange (eg. saplings required for tree plantation drives, etc.) </li>
<li> Forum for discussion on topics concerning climate change</li>
